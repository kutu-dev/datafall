# TODO

## Roadmap
- Change cancel to open file on finished download.
- Move unfinished downloaded chunks to another namespace.
- Add Enter support on Add menu.
- Add clean cache and "unfinished" cache buttons on a popup with info about size.
- Add history menu.
- Make the cancel button a square.

## Maybe
- Change both download methods to use streams so a real time progress bar is possible.
